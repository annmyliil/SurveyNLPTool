# Difficulties Encountered in Survey Analysis
CMP primarily uses JotForm to collect survey responses. In the past, our team relied on JotForm’s built-in analysis features to review survey results. However, these internal tools present several limitations that significantly restrict deeper analysis and long-term usability of the data:
- Inability to properly analyze “Other” responses
JotForm treats each “Other” response as a unique category rather than grouping them under a single “Other” option. As a result, during analysis, each free-text entry appears as a separate value. This requires manual data cleaning and recategorization outside of JotForm in order to meaningfully aggregate results.
- Lack of support for open-ended question analysis
JotForm’s internal analytics do not support systematic analysis of open-ended responses. This prevents us from extracting themes, frequently mentioned keywords, or insights from qualitative feedback, which is often critical for understanding participant needs and experiences.
- Limited ability to conduct cross-survey and trend analysis
JotForm’s analysis tools operate at the individual form level, making it difficult to combine data from multiple surveys over time. This limitation prevents longitudinal or trend analysis across different events, programs, or reporting periods.
