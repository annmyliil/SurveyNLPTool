# Difficulties Encountered in Survey Analysis
CMP primarily uses JotForm to collect survey responses. In the past, our team relied on JotForm’s built-in analysis features to review survey results. However, these internal tools present several limitations that significantly restrict deeper analysis and long-term usability of the data:
- Inability to properly analyze “Other” responses
JotForm treats each “Other” response as a unique category rather than grouping them under a single “Other” option:
As a result, during analysis, each free-text entry appears as a separate value. This requires manual data cleaning and recategorization outside of JotForm in order to meaningfully aggregate results.
- Lack of support for open-ended question analysis:
JotForm’s internal analytics do not support systematic analysis of open-ended responses. This prevents us from extracting themes, frequently mentioned keywords, or insights from qualitative feedback, which is often critical for understanding participant needs and experiences.
- Limited ability to conduct cross-survey and trend analysis:
JotForm’s analysis tools operate at the individual form level, making it difficult to combine data from multiple surveys over time. This limitation prevents longitudinal or trend analysis across different events, programs, or reporting periods.

# Project Motivation
- Enable deeper and more actionable data analysis: Although CMP serves hundreds of participants through its job fairs each year, survey data has historically been underutilized. In particular, CMP conducts two job fairs annually, creating a valuable and growing body of survey responses. These data contain critical insights—such as job seeker preferences in the current labor market, preferred employers and industries, and the types of employers participants would like to see in future job fairs. However, much of this information is embedded in open-ended survey questions, and the lack of appropriate analytical tools and workflows has limited our ability to systematically extract and leverage these insights.

- Establish a standardized and reusable data cleaning process: A well-designed survey analysis tool can standardize data cleaning and preprocessing across multiple survey rounds, regardless of differences in survey structure or question phrasing. This standardization enables aggregation and comparison of responses over time. Moreover, components of this tool can be reused for other surveys with similar question formats, such as the Career Advancement Program interest survey, improving consistency and efficiency across CMP’s data analysis efforts.

- Reduce manual workload and accelerate insight generation:
Currently, survey analysis requires significant manual effort, including reviewing open-ended responses and recategorizing inconsistent entries. By automating key data cleaning and analysis steps, this tool will significantly reduce the time required to process survey data and enable the generation of in-depth insights within a much shorter timeframe.

-Improve clarity and impact of reporting for stakeholders:
A standardized and systematic analysis workflow will allow CMP to present clearer, more consistent, and more insightful findings to board members and external stakeholders. Survey results can be transformed from raw response summaries into actionable insights that better inform program planning, employer outreach, and strategic decision-making. In addition, survey findings can be shared more effectively with partner organizations and the broader community to demonstrate program impact.
